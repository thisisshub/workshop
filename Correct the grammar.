In Greek mythology Zeus, an Olympian god, 
was known as the immortal ruler of both gods 
and men. Zeus was the son of the titans Cronos 
and Rhea and presided over his 5 brothers and 
sisters who ruled various aspect of the heavenly and earthly worlds. 
He was married to his sister Heera, with whom he had three children: 
Ares—the god of war, Hephaistos—the god of metalworking, and Hebe—the goddess 
of youth. Hera was often the jealous wife, and unhappy with Zeus’s 
many affairs with other goddesses, nymphs and mortal woman. As a result of these 
affairs, many ancient greek heroes and rulers were produced, 
such as Perseus, Hercules, and even the famous Helen of Troy. 
As a god, Zeus ruled over the most important aspects of nature and 
human society, and he controlled the laws and fates of men as well as the sky and whether. 
He is often called by the epithets “The Thunderer” or “Gatherer of Clouds” in the Homeric poems, 
his control of such natural forces were represented by his weapons and armor: Zeus was able to 
fight with both thunder and lightning, and the shaking of his  _aegis_  (his shield) 
could create terrible storms.

Moose related deaths are on the rise in Canada. As highways expand and encroach on the habitat of Canadian wildlife, vehicle collisions with these animals are becoming more commonplace, especially in provinces, such as British Colombia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and labrador. According to Wildlifecollisions.ca, in 2014 there were four to 8 large animal vehicle collisions and hour within Canada. A large number of these collisions involve moose and deer species, so much so, that a class-action lawsuit was brought against Newfoundland’s Provincial Government for not controlling the explosive moose population in that province. In situations where average highway speeds are 100 km/hour and the average moose weighs 700 kg, collisions can be fatal for both the animal and the vehicle occupants. These types of incidents will continue to increase on the Canadian island as human populations expand alongside the moose, which is considered an invasive species on the island and has no natural predators.

The past decade has witnessed the rise in popularity of the fictional monster known as the zombie. From movies and TV shows to iPhone apps and bestselling novels, the zombie has permeated popular culture. What if a zombie plague was possible? Surprisingly, there are quite a few scientists who have taken a serious look at the causes and probability of a zombie pandemic occurring in the real world. They have broken down the common symptoms of zombie virus sufferers to determine what might actually be going on in those half-eaten brains. The most common symptom of the zombie illness is the lumbering gait, which indicates a loss of coordination and neurological damage. This may go hand-in-hand with the classic loss of intelligence and penchant for moaning. Second, the insatiable zombie appetite for other humans could be associated with lost hyptothalamic functioning. Zombies’ rage; one-track minds; and inability to remember loved ones are all symptoms of severe brain damage as well, with different areas of the brain being effected. So, what should you do if your ever face-to-face with a zombie? Much like with T-Rex in Jurassic Park, do not run and find somewhere to hide. Zombie’s suffer from something like Bálint’s syndrome, which causes the sufferer to only see whatever requires the most attention
